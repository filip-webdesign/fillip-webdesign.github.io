        <h1> Being Croatian in America</h1> 
        <p> In the land of burgers and fries, I aspire to be, <br> A Croatian student, playing soccer for free. <br> <em><strong> With skill in my feet, and love for the game,<br> I dribble past attackers  they will never be same!</strong> </em> <br> But the confusion, from people I meet, <br> they think I'm speaking gibberish, its quite a feat. <br> I Shout Hvala for thanks, and Dobar dan for hi, <br> They scratch their heads, wondering why.<br> Here is the end of my inspiration, <br> I hope it is fine. <br> being Croatian in America is not easy, <br> Im not going to lie! </p></body>
